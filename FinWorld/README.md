## 🎯 Research Contributions

Our main contributions are threefold:

1. **Unified Framework**: We propose a unified, end-to-end framework for training and evaluation of ML, DL, RL, LLMs, and LLM agents, covering four critical financial AI task types including time series forecasting, algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and LLM applications.

2. **Modular Design**: The framework features a modular architecture that enables flexible construction of custom models and tasks, including the development of personalized LLM agents. The system supports efficient distributed training and testing across multiple environments.

3. **Comprehensive Benchmark**: We provide support for multimodal heterogeneous data with over 800 million samples, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for the financial AI community. Extensive experiments across four task types demonstrate the framework's flexibility and effectiveness.
